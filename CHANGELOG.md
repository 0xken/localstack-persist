# Changelog

## [2.3.2] - 2023-11-03

_Based on [LocalStack 2.3.2](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/releases/tag/v2.3.2)_

### Added

- Support for the new opt-in LocalStack-native S3 provider (`PROVIDER_OVERRIDE_S3=v3`). When using the V3 provider, any existing (pre-V3) persisted S3 objects will be automatically migrated to the new V3 format. Other S3 data (e.g. unfinished multipart uploads, CORS rules) will not be migrated and will be lost when switching to the V3 provider. Data saved in the V3 format cannot be loaded when using the default (pre-V3) S3 provider. In other words, you can safely switch from the default S3 provider to the V3 S3 provider without losing any persisted S3 objects, but you then won't be able to switch back again.
